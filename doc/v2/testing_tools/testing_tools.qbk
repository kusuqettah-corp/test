[section:testing_tools The __UTF__ testing tools]
The __UTF__'s supplies a toolbox of testing tools to ease creation and maintenance of test programs and
provide a  uniform error reporting mechanism. The toolbox supplied in most part in a form of macro and function
declarations. While the functions can be called directly, the usual way to use testing tools is via convenience
macros. All macros arguments are calculated once, so it's safe to pass complex expressions in their place.
All tools automatically supply an error location: a file name and a line number. The testing tools are intended
for unit test code rather than library or production code, where throwing exceptions, using `assert()`,
`boost::concept_check` or `BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT()` may be more suitable
ways to detect and report errors. For list of all supplied testing tools and usage examples see the reference.
