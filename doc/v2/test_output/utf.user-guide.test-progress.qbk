[#ref_output_progress][section:test_output_progress Progression display]
In case if the test module involves lengthy computation split among multiple test cases you may be interested in 
progress monitor. The test runners supplied with the __UTF__ support simple text progress display, implemented based
on 
``
  boost::progress_display
``

[footnote The __UTF__ interfaces allow implementing an advanced GUI based test runner with arbitrary progress display controls]. 

The progress display output is enabled using the __UTF__ parameter __param_show_progress__.


The __UTF__ has no ability to estimate how long the test case execution is going to take and the manual test 
progress update is not supported at this point. The __UTF__ tracks the progress on test case level. If you want to 
see more frequent progress update, you need to split the test into multiple test cases.


In default configuration both test log and test progress outputs are directed into standard output stream. Any test 
log messages are going to interfere with test progress display. To prevent this you can either set log level to 
lower level or redirect either test log or test progress output into different stream during test module 
initialization. Use following interface to redirect test progress output:


``
  boost::unit_test::progress_monitor.set_stream( std::ostream& )
``
