[#boost_test_reports][section:reports Reported information]
When an assertion fails, __BOOST_TEST__ reports details and values on the operands of `statement` that lead to the failure. 

[bt_example boost_test_macro3..BOOST_TEST reporting]

In the above example, the values of the operands are reported for inspection, which is more valuable as a copy
of the full statement. However, we can observe that they are not treated symmetrically:

* "`a - 1 < b`" reports `"13 - 1 >= 12" failed`
* "`b > a - 1`" reports `"12 <= 12" failed`

More details on how the __UTF__ parses the statement are given in [link boost_test.testing_tools.internal_details this] section.
