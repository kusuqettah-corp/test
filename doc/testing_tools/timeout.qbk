[section:timeout timeout (decorator)]

``
timeout(unsigned seconds);
``

Decorator `timeout` specifies time (in seconds) that sets the maximum allowed duration of a test case. If this time is 
exceeded the test unit is forced to stop and is reported as failure.

[bt_example decorator_11..decorator timeout]

Applied at test suite level, this decorator has no effect.

[caution Decorator `timeout` has no effect on Windows build. This feature is not implemented on Windows yet.]
