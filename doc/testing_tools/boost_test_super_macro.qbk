[section:boost_test_super_macro `BOOST_TEST` or the Swiss Army knife]

Once a test case has been declared, the body of this test should be written. A test case is a 
sequence of operations in which *assertions* are inserted. Those assertions run /statements/ that verify the integrity 
of the pre and post conditions of the operations. Assertions have different incidences on the test itself:

- requirements: this is the strongest level of the assertion. The test stops if the statement in the assertion fails. This
  type of assertions should be used when the reminder of the 
- basic checks: 
- warnings: 

A unique interface for assertions is 

* `BOOST_TEST_WARN`
* `BOOST_TEST_CHECK` or just `BOOST_TEST`
* `BOOST_TEST_REQUIRE`
