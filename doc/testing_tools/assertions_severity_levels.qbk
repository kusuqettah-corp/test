[section:tools_assertion_severity_level Assertion severity level]

Not only __BOOST_TEST__, but all the testing tools are supplied in three flavours/levels, from lowest to highest:

# `WARN`
# `CHECK` and
# `REQUIRE`

For example: 

* BOOST_WARN_THROW
* BOOST_CHECK_THROW
* BOOST_REQUIRE_THROW

If an assertion designated by the tool passes, confirmation message can be printed in log output 
[footnote to manage what messages appear in the test log stream, 
 set the proper [link boost_test.test_output.log_runtime_config log level]].
If an assertion designated by the tool failed, depending on the level following will happened 
[footnote in some cases log message can be slightly different to reflect failed tool specifics]:

[table:assertions_severity_levels Assertions severity levels
  [
    [Level]
    [Test log content]
    [Errors counter]
    [Test execution]
  ]
  
  [
    [WARN]
    [warning in `<test-case-name>`: condition `<assertion description>` is not satisfied]
    [not affected]
    [continues]
  ]
  [
    [CHECK]
    [error in `<test-case-name>`: test `<assertion description>` failed]
    [increased]
    [continues]
  ]
  [
    [REQUIRE]
    [fatal error in `<test-case-name>`: critical test `<assertion description>` failed]
    [increased]
    [aborts]
  ]
]

[note in the above table, the ['test execution] is related to the current test case ['only]. Hence ['"aborts"] means 
 that the current test case is aborted, but other test cases in the test tree are still executed.]

Regularly you should use `CHECK` level tools to implement your assertions. You can use `WARN` level tools to validate
aspects less important then correctness: performance, portability, usability etc. You should use `REQUIRE` level
tools only if continuation of the test case doesn't make sense if this assertions fails.
