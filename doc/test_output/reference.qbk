[section:test_output_macro_checkpoint `BOOST_TEST_CHECKPOINT`]
Sets up a named check point. 

[tip See the [link boost_test.users_guide.test_output.checkpoints checkpoint] section for more details.]

[section:test_output_macro_passpoint `BOOST_TEST_PASSPOINT`]
Sets up an unnamed check point. 

[tip See the [link boost_test.users_guide.test_output.checkpoints checkpoint] section for more details.]
[endsect]



[section:test_output_macro_message `BOOST_TEST_MESSAGE`]
Outputs a custom message into the test log.

[tip See the [link boost_test.users_guide.test_output.test_output_macro_message corresponding] section for more details.]

[section:test_output_macro_info `BOOST_TEST_INFO`]
Defines a message to be printed as part of the context of the first encountered assertion, if it fails. For more details see [link boost_test.users_guide.test_output.contexts here].
[endsect]

[section:test_output_macro_context `BOOST_TEST_CONTEXT`]
Defines a scope and a message to be printed as part of the context of every failed assertion within the scope. For more details see [link boost_test.users_guide.test_output.contexts here].

[section:test_output_macro_disable_type `BOOST_TEST_DONT_PRINT_LOG_VALUE`]
Disables the automatic printing of a value. This macro is relevant 

* a type is used in a comparison assertion (such as __BOOST_LEVEL_GE__ for instance)
* when the type being compared does not implement a suitable `operator <<` for streaming out the value into the 
  test log stream
